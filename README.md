# Overview
**Questions?  devtest@eimprovement.com**

Thank you for taking the time to take our test. You will need to complete **one** of of following developer candidate tests:

- [MVC](https://github.com/eimprovement/Dev-Test-MVC)
- [Angular 7](https://github.com/eimprovement/Dev-Test-Angular7)
- [React](https://github.com/eimprovement/Dev-Test-React)

You will use one of the starter apps, along with our API, to create a full stack application that will allow users to read, update, create and delete pets.

In case you are interested, our API uses the popular Pet Store data set as its source for data.

- This exercise is intended to be an example of a real world problem. Please use any and all resources at your disposal including, but not limited to, the internet, friends/colleagues, etc.

- You will be expected to demonstrate coding skills in alignment with industry best practices. Please focus on what you would consider "the right way" to write / design an application.

- Do not hesitate to ask questions. We are available via **devtest@eimprovement.com**

- Upon completion, you will be expected to present your application, via a pull request, to the eImprovement team. Be prepared to explain the thought process behind your code. Additionally, we would be interested in understanding any improvements that you might suggest.

- There are no tricks or "gotchas" in this code sample. If you are having problems connecting or see anything else strange, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
